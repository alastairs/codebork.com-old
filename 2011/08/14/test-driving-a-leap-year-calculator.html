          <div class="article-content">
            <p>In preparation for <a href="http://codebork.com/2011/08/14/camdugs-first-ever-dojo.html">CAMDUG’s first ever Dojo</a> yesterday, I worked through the Leap Year kata, which I had intended to run in the first session, “Introduction to TDD”.  I ended up swapping it out for the Roman Numerals kata, because I got through two iterations of the exercise in about 20 minutes.  However, I thought it would be useful to share the problem and my approaches to it with my readers.<br />
<!--break-->
The Problem
========</p>

<p>Like many kata, the problem is simply stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write a function that returns true or false depending on whether its input integer is a leap
year or not.  A leap year is defined as one that is divisible by 4, but is not otherwise divisible by 
100 unless it is also divisible by 400.</p>

  <p>For example, 2001 is a typical common year and 1996 is a typical leap year, whereas 1900 is an
atypical common year and 2000 is an atypical leap year.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="first-iteration">First iteration</h1>

<p>For my first iteration, I took an approach that I think is akin to Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD).  That is to say, I took the four example years from the problem statement above and used them as my acceptance cases.  If all four acceptance tests pass, the system could be considered complete.</p>

<p>[gist:1145099:acceptance_tests.cs]</p>

<p>[gist:1145099:implementation.cs]</p>

<p>I was left a bit uneasy with this approach, however: it seemed too easy, and I was only testing the examples given.  How did I know that, for example, 1984 would be considered a leap year and 1985 wouldn’t?  What happens if -1984 is provided to the method?  What about 0, and other test cases I haven’t even considered yet?</p>

<h1 id="second-iteration">Second iteration</h1>

<p>I then deleted my first attempt; this is an important step when doing many iterations of a kata as it helps you to clear your mind of the details of previous solutions and look at the problem anew.  I tackled the problem with my more usual form of TDD in the second iteration, which is to say I wrote tests to exercise the method contract rather than fit the provided examples.</p>

<p>My first test exercises the most basic rule of a leap year: if it is divisible by 4, then it is a leap year:</p>

<p>[gist:1145103:FirstTest.cs]</p>

<p>I went with the TDD approach of writing the simplest possible code to make the test pass:</p>

<p>[gist:1145103:FirstImpl.cs]</p>

<p>My second test exercises the inverse condition: if the year is not divisible by 4, then it is not a leap year:</p>

<p>[gist:1145103:SecondTest.cs]</p>

<p>And again, the simplest possible code to get this to pass is:</p>

<p>[gist:1145103:SecondImpl.cs]</p>

<p>I jumped a bit ahead with my third test, and ended up breaking my flow: I wrote a passing test.  That’s a bad thing to do, because it means you have to really think hard about whether or not it is passing <em>for the right reason</em>.  If they’re passing for the wrong reason and you leave it be, you’re likely to run into problems later.</p>

<p>[gist:1145103:ThirdTest.cs]</p>

<p>Because this test passes, there’s no implementation step.</p>

<p>Instead of writing a test for the situation where the year is divisible by 400, I should have written a test for the situation where the year is divisible by 100, which should return false:</p>

<p>[gist:1145103:FourthTest.cs]</p>

<p>And there is an associated implementation to write for this test:</p>

<p>[gist:1145103:FourthImpl.cs]</p>

<p>Aha!  Now test 3 fails.  It is hopefully now made clear why I should have written these last two tests the other way around: tests should only start to fail when you break something, which I have not done here.  Anyway, I’m now in the situation I would have been in if I had written the third and fourth tests the other way around, and I can write the implementation for the third test:</p>

<p>[gist:1145103:ThirdImpl.cs]</p>

<p>An integral part of the TDD workflow is refactoring: the rhythm that should be adopted is “Red, Green, Refactor”.  My chosen refactoring was to pull out the small amount of logic testing whether a year was divisible by 100 into a new method called <code class="highlighter-rouge">IsCentury()</code>:</p>

<p>[gist:1145103:Refactor.cs]</p>

<p>At this point I decided to stop, but there are more refactorings to do (e.g., the code checking whether the year is divisible by 400, and perhaps the one for years divisible by 4 as well).  I felt more comfortable with this approach because I was testing the general rules rather than the specific examples.  I felt comfortable with the idea of extending this test suite and implementation to handle some of the edge cases (negative numbers, etc) I mentioned above.  I think the code for the second iteration is a fair bit cleaner than the first, even though there’s only a couple of small refactorings between them.</p>

<p>I’m interested to read feedback on both these approaches: am I missing something with ATDD?  Is my usual TDD approach flawed?  Am I refactoring early enough in my workflow?</p>
