I have a couple of new posts waiting in the wings for this series.  They're both quite lengthy, so they're taking a bit of time to write.  

Things have also got considerably busier at work in the last week or so, and it's proving nigh on impossible to dedicate the time to reading and absorbing the material.  As such, there will likely be a bit of a gap in my postings on this series after I've cleared out the back-log.  

If you've been enjoying the series so far, and/or if you have any feedback on how to improve it, etc., please leave me a comment or two.  

'til next time...  Happy coding :-)
