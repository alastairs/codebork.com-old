I randomly came across this earlier this evening: <a href="http://codeclimber.net.nz/archive/2007/07/15/CruiseControl.NET-Monitor-Vista-Gadget-version-0.9.5.aspx">a Cruise Control.NET gadget for the Vista sidebar</a>!
<!--break-->
This is a pretty sweet gadget, which gives you a greater insight into the the status of your build than the CCTray app does.  The current release is at version 0.9.5, and the project seems to have gone quiet since that version was released over a year ago.  

I haven't tried it out as I'm not (currently) running Vista on my home PC, but I'm hoping to give it a go at work to keep an eye on <a href="http://www.analysisuk.com/blog/" title="Stephen Harrison's blog">Steve's</a> CC.NET server! ;-)  Speaking of which, I may look into setting up my own <a href="http://ccnet.thoughtworks.com/" title="Cruise Control.NET Homepage">CC.NET</a> server at work as a proof-of-concept replacement for our own CI server (which is sparsely-featured, and is custom-developed, I believe).  

Further updates soon!
