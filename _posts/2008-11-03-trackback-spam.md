As you may have noticed, I've not blogged in a while.  The good news is, I'm back! :-)

Unfortunately, over roughly the same period, I've not really been keeping on top of clearing out my trackback spam, to the point where I deleted in the region of 1000 spam trackbacks this evening.  Short of disabling the trackback function (which I don't really want to do), I'm after a bit of advice on combating trackback spam.  

Oddly, I don't have any problems with comment spam at all.  

Comments welcome, as always! :-)
