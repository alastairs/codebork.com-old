In case you'd somehow missed <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/26/windows_7_release_candidate/" title="Microsoft names Windows 7 RC1 dates">the news</a> and <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/20/windows_7_release_candidate_5_may/" title="Windows 7 Release Candiate coming 5 May">the leaks</a>, the RC of Windows 7 is publicly available as of today.  It's been available to MSDN subscribers (and, by extension, the wider Internet) since last Thursday, but Microsoft are officially opening the doors to the unwashed hordes tomorrow.
<!--break-->
I'll post a review of the RC once I've got it installed.  Based on my <a href="http://www.codebork.com/science-and-technology/2009/02/24/windows-7.html" title="Windows 7">previous</a> <a href="http://www.codebork.com/science-and-technology/2009/03/21/windows-7-aero-snap.html" title="Windows 7 Aero Snap">experiences</a> with Windows 7, I'm excited to try the RC, and the famed <a href="http://community.winsupersite.com/blogs/paul/archive/2009/04/24/secret-no-more-revealing-virtual-windows-xp-for-windows-7.aspx">"XP Mode"</a>, which should hopefully solve my one backwards compatibility issue: my <a href="http://www.netgear.com/Products/Entertainment/DigitalMediaPlayers/EVA8000.aspx" title="Netgear EVA8000">Netgear EVA8000</a>'s desktop software component doesn't work with the "new" Windows 7 firewall.  I'm also hoping I'll be able to get my iPod Nano syncing with iTunes again (ideally outside of XP mode).<sup>*</sup>

In the meantime, go give the RC a spin.  Use a <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr> if you don't have a machine to spare; the experience will still be more than favourable.

<sup>*</sup>For the record, I don't believe this to be an iTunes/Windows 7 bug; rather, it's a problem with my Windows 7 beta installation.  Sync initially was working correctly on Windows 7, and I think something happened with a dodgy eject sequence that screwed up iTunes' pairing with the Nano.
