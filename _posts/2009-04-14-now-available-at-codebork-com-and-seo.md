I thought it was high time that my blog, being called CodeBork an' all, be located at a codebork domain, so I just bought codebork.com and codebork.co.uk.  codebork.co.uk has been configured as a ServerAlias for codebork.com.  The site as a whole will continue to be accessible indefinitely at the current domain, alastairsmith.me.uk, but requests to this domain will be redirected (via a 301 Moved Permanently response) to codebork.com.  Hopefully this will go some way to avoid annoying Google; after all, I now <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/04/how-to-make-money-with-seo.html" title="How to make money with SEO">"own"</a> the CodeBork search term on Google, and it would be dumb to upset that.

In fact, it was that link (from <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/" title="Seth's Blog">Seth Godin's rather excellent blog</a>) that put me on to the idea.  I'd mulled with buying these domains for a while, but hadn't thought it really necessary.  Given that my blog has been going under the name "CodeBork" for nearly a year now, and two of my blog posts currently occupy the top spots on <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=codebork" title="Search Google for &quot;CodeBork&quot;">the appropriate Google search</a>, I thought I'd try a spot of <abbr title="Search Engine Optimisation">SEO</abbr> and see if I can't get more than the just the first two results.

So there we have it: the next step in "building the CodeBork brand".  Or possibly the "brand of Alastair", depending on how egocentric I'm feeling. :-)
