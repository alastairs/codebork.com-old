I find the whole meta-blogging thing a bit tiresome, really, but I thought I should probably do a quick update as CodeBork is moving home!  There are two main things you will notice: 
<ol><li>it should be <em>much</em> snappier than it was before, having the full benefit of a fatter pipe than an "up to 8Mbps" ADSL connection</li>
<li>Some of the images have disappeared.  They've been transferred successfully, I just need to win an argument with Drupal to get them to display.</li></ol>

If you're interested in the gory details, CodeBork is now hosted with <a href="http://mediatemple.net/" title="MediaTemple homepage">MediaTemple</a> via their <a href="http://mediatemple.net/webhosting/gs/" title="MediaTemple Grid-Service (gs) hosting">Grid-Service (gs) package</a>.  This is an interesting service that offers you not just one machine, but a whole grid of them, allowing your site to scale when needed.  So, on the tiny off-chance that my blog should make it to the front page of <a href="http://www.digg.com/">Digg</a>, or be posted to <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, and thereby receive thousands of hits a minute, I know my site will be able to handle it. 

The package is priced at a fixed $20/month, and offers 100GB storage, 1TB bandwidth allowance, and up to 100 unique sites may be hosted from the one package.  <a href="http://www.reelcritic.co.uk/" title="Film views, reviews and news">ReelCritic</a> will be going live from the same account in a few days, hopefully.  MediaTemple do a 30-day free trial if you are interested in playing around with the service.

This, along with developing the new ReelCritic site, has been taking up most of my spare time recently, which is why I haven't managed to get anything obvious done, like continuing my <a href="http://www.codebork.com/category/coding/code-complete" title="Code Complete series on CodeBork">Code Complete series</a>.  I hope to get back on to that soon.

<strong>Update:</strong> Apologies to anyone seeing this post twice.  I re-restored my database backup to resolve the problems I was having and it has mostly worked.  I now just have to fix up the images.
