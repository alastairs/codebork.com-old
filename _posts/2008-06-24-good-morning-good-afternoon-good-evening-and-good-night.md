Yes, my blog has a new home, and by some weird twist of fate, you've stumbled upon it.  It could also be that you followed the link from my old blog.

A little ironically, this is actually more of a homecoming for my blog; see, for now, it's hosted by myself on my Linux box, which is where my Soapbox first started back in the summer of 2005.  I lost that in a hard disk crash (probably; I can't quite remember, and they seem to happen to me quite a bit.  I'm unlucky that way.) and from the flames, the phoenix of the appropriately-titled Soapbox 2.0 arose, generously hosted by the University of Warwick.  Falling in and out of use at various points over a period of about two years, I finally gave up on it in January this year (well, that's when the last post was, at least), wanting to do something more with it than I was able to on the Warwick Blog system.  

What is that I want to do that I couldn't do previously?  Well, I have a large number of interests, such as music, coding (which also happens to be my job), and films to name but a few, and I wanted to be able to blog about these in a more separate manner than I was able previously; to be able to maintain separate blogs for each, almost.  I also wanted to put together a personal website, something more than just a blog.  We'll see how well that turns out.  

I'm also hoping that this will serve to improve my skills as a developer.  In his recent <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/">Coding Horror</a> post on <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001138.html">Code Kata</a>, Jeff Atwood lists as one of his own two Kata steps maintaining a blog, so you, dear reader, are part of a grand experiment!  To this end, I expect the coding section to expand the most rapidly, and so I apologise to all my non-technical readers who may be turned off by this.  I'll do my best to keep the other sections updated frequently too.
