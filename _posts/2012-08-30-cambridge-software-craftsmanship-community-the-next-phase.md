Three months ago, [I founded the Cambridge Software Craftsmanship Community](http://codebork.com/2012/07/04/cambridge-software-craftsmanship-community.html), and I am pleased to say that it has grown well over that period: we now have nearly 60 practitioners in our community! On Tuesday, we will be holding our [third monthly Round-Table Discussion](http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Software-Craftsmanship/events/76838042/) at Granta Design, but this is not what I want to talk about now.  I want to talk about the next phase of the community's development.  

As I laid out in my [introductory post](http://codebork.com/2012/07/04/cambridge-software-craftsmanship-community.html), phase two of my plan is to introduce the hands-on sessions that are so popular at the [London Software Craftsmanship Community](http://www.meetup.com/London-Software-Craftsmanship/), and this phase begins this September.  On 18 September, we will hold our first hands-on session at Granta Design.  This will take the form of an introduction to TDD, with the intention of providing a mentoring component as part of the exercise.  Craftsmanship exercises are paired, and implemented using the practice of TDD, so it is my hope that this session will provide an introduction to the format for future sessions, as well as in some cases introducing people to a new skill.  We will pair experienced TDD-ers with less-experienced TDD-ers and work through a relatively simple kata, such as the Roman Numerals kata.  

I am also very pleased to announce that our second hands-on session will be delivered by [Sandro Mancuso](http://craftedsw.blogspot.co.uk/), founder of the London Software Craftsmanship Community, at the end of October.  The details of the session are still to be finalised and announced, so keep an eye on Twitter (under the [#camswcraft](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23camswcraft) hashtag) and the [CSCC's Meetup site](http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Software-Craftsmanship/) for updates.

It's a really exciting time for the Cambridge Software Craftsmanship Community. I feel really privileged to be a part of it, and continue to be humbled by the feedback that I get. If you're looking for a group to discuss and improve software development with other developers who want the same, check us out.  We think you'll like it.
