Last night I attended <a href="http://www.nxtgenug.net/">NxtGenUG</a> Cambridge's September event, featuring Guy Smith-Ferrier speaking on Multi-Touch support in Windows 7 and WPF.  This was an excellent speech (as I've come to expect from NxtGen over the last year or so), and I've <a href="http://www.evernote.com/pub/alastairsmith/publicnotebook">posted</a> in a public <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a> notebook my notes from both Guy's talk and the nugget beforehand which provided an introduction to Kanban and Lean development.   

Also available there are my notes from last month's NxtGenUG Cambridge event, on cleaning up ASP.NET WebForms applications (less detailed), and from August's Guathon in London, which mostly covers tips and tricks for using Visual Studio 2010, including some neat tricks to make it play more nicely with <abbr title="Test-Driven Development">TTD</abbr>.
