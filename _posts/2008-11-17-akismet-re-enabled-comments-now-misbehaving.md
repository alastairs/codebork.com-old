As I mentioned in <a href="http://www.alastairsmith.me.uk/random-stuff/2008/11/03/trackback-spam.html" title="Trackback Spam">a previous post</a>, I've been suffering quite badly from trackback spam.  I dread to think what it's done to my Google ranking (and related search terms), and what impact it's had on my bandwidth consumption.

That aside, as <a href="http://www.oneangrydwarf.co.uk/">Tim</a> suggested, I have re-enabled <a href="http://www.akismet.com/">Akismet</a>.  We'll see whether this sorts out the problem, although I'm quite hopeful.  

I'm afraid this does have a knock-on effect for you, dear reader.  The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/akismet">Akismet module</a> for Drupal is still undergoing the upgrade to Drupal 6 and is still a bit buggy...  As such, when you submit a comment, you will end up with a blank screen; the module calls through to a function that was removed in Drupal 6.  <a href="http://drupal.org/node/240894">This has been logged</a> as a bug, and I've looked into it myself in some detail, but haven't worked out how to resolve it yet.  There's no patch available to resolve this issue yet, and from the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/akismet">module homepage</a>:
<blockquote cite="http://drupal.org/project/akismet">Sept 5, 2008 Update: this module is pretty unsupported at this point. </blockquote>

My apologies for the inconvenience.  If it starts to annoy you, please leave a comment saying so ;-)  More seriously, drop me an email using <a href="http://www.alastairsmith.me.uk/contact">the contact form</a> and I'll look for an alternative solution.
