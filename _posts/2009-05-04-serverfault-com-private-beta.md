You may remember <a href="http://www.codebork.com/coding/2008/09/11/stack-overflow.html" title="Stack Overflow on Codebork">a post</a> I wrote a while back advertising the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" title="Stack Overflow">Stack Overflow</a> site created by <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/" title="Joel on Software Blog">Joel Spolsky</a> and <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com" title="Coding Horror Blog">Jeff Atwood</a>.  It's been live a bit over six months, and it's grown enormously in features and user base since I wrote that post.  

<a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/server-fault-private-beta-begins/" title="Server Fault Private Beta Begins">Jeff and Joel have now put the software behind Stack Overflow to another use</a>, powering a System Administration community site entitled <a href="http://serverfault.com" title="Server Fault">Server Fault</a>, currently in private beta.
<!--break-->
This is a somewhat less private beta than the Stack Overflow beta.  If you have greater than 100 reputation on Stack Overflow, you can simply provide the password "alt.sysadmin.recovery" (as published on the Stack Overflow blog) and log in with your Open ID; you'll be rewarded with 100 reputation points on Server Fault for your trouble.  If you don't currently use Stack Overflow, you can sign in with an Open ID account and send an email to team@serverfault.com to be granted access.  

This promises to be another great resource.  As with the Stack Overflow site, off-topic questions will generally be closed fairly quickly (and moderators are already in place), but I doubt many people will see that as a bad thing; it's certainly not hurt Stack Overflow's adoption.  

Go check it out, post a question or two, feed back some answers, and play around.  Given that Jeff has <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/03/it-stack-overflow-update-naming-is-hard/" title="IT Stack Overflow Update: Naming is Hard">repeatedly</a> <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/server-fault-private-beta-begins/" title="Server Fault Private Beta Begins">described</a> the Stack Overflow code base as "mature", I've a feeling it will probably go live fairly rapidly.
