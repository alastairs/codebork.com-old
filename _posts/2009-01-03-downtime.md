I've suffered a bit of downtime of late &mdash; about the last month, actually &mdash; which is why my blog has been unavailable and my web frameworks' evaluation has crawled to a halt.  Apologies to anyone that might have been following that series.  

The good news is, however, that I'm back for 2009 thanks to a particularly felicitous finding on my laptop that resolved the underlying problem.  I'm hoping to move at least my blog (if not some of my other bits and pieces) to a more reliable hosting package sometime this year.  363 days and counting to accomplish this!
