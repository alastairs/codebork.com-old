I came across a useful directory of freelance musicians the other day.  Cunningly, it's called Freelance Musicians, and can be found at http://www.freelance-musicians.info.  It's UK only (currently; that may or may not change), and provides facilities for listing individuals and groups/ensembles.  You can check out my own listing at http://www.freelance-musicians.info/musicians/231/.  

It's quite a new service, and there's only 152 musicians currently listed, but go sign up and swell their numbers if you've got a musical talent to flaunt!
