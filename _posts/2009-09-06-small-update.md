That busy period at work that I mentioned hasn't really ended, and by the sounds of things it won't be any time soon.  As such, it's likely that my Code Complete series is going to be put on hold for a while longer as we ride this current and move on.

I also went away for three weeks which didn't help my blogging any :-)  I got back yesterday from a week in Northumberland, preceded by two weeks in Bordeaux.  This was a rather longer stay than intended: on the eighth day (of ten) one of the cars we took abroad broke down and had to be towed away to be mended by the "local" Seat dealership.  The other car went home as planned with just under half the group that had to be back at work the following day, whilst the rest of us stayed behind to wait the car's repair.  The problem turned out to be worse than originally thought.  More than just a snapped fan belt and broken air conditioning both were replaced over the course of two days.  By the time we got back to the UK late on the evening of Friday 28 August, approximately 48 hours late, we'd developed a serious case of cabin fever, and we were borderline hysterical.  Needless to say I needed a holiday to recover from the holiday, and so I spent another twelve hours driving to Northumberland.  I had a very relaxing week amongst the bleak and remote scenery there, and I'm now just about rested enough to go back to work!

I'll try to get my blog back on track on other topics and home projects that are hopefully of interest to you, dear reader.
