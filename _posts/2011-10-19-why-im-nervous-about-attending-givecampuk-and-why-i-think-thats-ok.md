So earlier today, I posted on Twitter that [Meanwhile, I'm quietly shitting myself about #givecampuk which is in just two days' time!](http://twitter.com/#!/alastairs/statuses/126623240788520960)

This prompted a slew of replies, not least from [Paul Stack](http://www.paulstack.co.uk/), one of the [GiveCamp UK](http://www.givecamp.org.uk/) organisers, who said

> "I wish there was no nerves over #givecampuk - we are all in the same boat - noone is better than anyone else :)"

There was some discussion on this topic a few weeks back, which Paul addressed in an excellent [blog post](http://www.paulstack.co.uk/blog/post/why-you-shouldnt-feel-nervous-about-givecampuk.aspx) at the time, essentially stating that no one person knows *everything* about software development, and everyone (including the likes of Scott Guthrie) considers themselves to be learning from other people all the time.  

Here's the thing: I get all that, and I agree with it; the continual learning process is why I love this career that I've chosen as much as I do.  But still I'm nervous.  Why?

Paul said that GiveCamp UK is "**NOT A JOB INTERVIEW**" (emphasis his), and I do agree with that statement, but I think it *is* like the first day of a new job.  It has the same unknowns: people, project, product, practices and processes, and in that regard I think those nerves I'm feeling are *perfectly healthy*.  They're the same nerves I felt when I started at Granta a little over a year ago.  They're the same nerves I feel when I play a solo bassoon gig.  They're same the nerves I still feel sometimes when playing an orchestral gig.  They're the same nerves I'm feeling for my new role leading a small Agile team at work.  It's not so much performance anxiety (although there is certainly an element of that) as jitters fuelled by excitement and the unknown; it's the build-up of adrenaline as I get to face another great challenge.

GiveCampUK is going to a fantastic experience and, most likely, a massive rush.  These nerves are just the start of it.
