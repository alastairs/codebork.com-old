It was <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/super-user-semi-private-beta-begins/" title="Super User Semi-Private Beta begins">announced</a> a few days ago that the <a href="http://superuser.com/" title="Super User">Super User</a> private beta has begun.  Instructions on accessing it are available from <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/super-user-semi-private-beta-begins/" title="Super User Semi-Private Beta begins">the Stack Overflow blog announcement</a>.

Jeff Atwood <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/the-stack-overflow-trilogy/" title="The Stack Overflow trilogy">described a while back</a> how he always envisaged a trilogy of Stack Overflow sites, using the trilogy of the original <em>Star Wars</em> films as a touchstone.  Super User is, therefore, the <em>Return of the Jedi</em> of the trilogy, and <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/the-stack-overflow-trilogy/" title="The Stack Overflow Trilogy">comes with the appropriate health warning Ewoks</a>:
<blockquote>
Superuser.com  <strong>For computer enthusiasts and power users</strong>

One word: <em>ewoks</em>. But also, Leia in a bikini. Still canon, but little odder than the earlier movies. In other words, things are going to get a little .. crazy .. in the finale.
</blockquote>

This is a (mostly) no-holds barred community site, where any question on computers is fair game.  

Oh, and if you link your various accounts together, provided you have >200 rep on the other site, you get a +100 bump in rep.  You can also import your profile details from the other sites.  

Why not check it out?  And <em>do</em> play nicely with the Ewoks!
