excerpt: !ruby/string:Sequel::SQL::Blob "<a href=\"http://blog.jpboodhoo.com/\" title=\"Develop
  with Passion\">Jean-Paul Boodhoo</a> put together a very clear and concise introduction
  to NAnt back in 2006.  It's helped me no end converting a couple of my projects
  from Visual Studio Ctrl+Shift+B/MSBuild to NAnt today; I heartily recommend it as
  an introduction to NAnt.  You can find the index to the series at http://blog.jpboodhoo.com/NAntStarterSeries.aspx.

<a href="http://blog.jpboodhoo.com/" title="Develop with Passion">Jean-Paul Boodhoo</a> put together a very clear and concise introduction to NAnt back in 2006.  It's helped me no end converting a couple of my projects from Visual Studio Ctrl+Shift+B/MSBuild to NAnt today; I heartily recommend it as an introduction to NAnt.

Also worth checking out is <a href="http://www.nantbuilder.com/">NAnt Builder</a>.  I've got the trial version for now, but I'm seriously considering buying a copy; it makes working with NAnt's XML-based makefiles much more pleasant.  The only thing holding me back is a couple of usability issues that I will report to the developers soon (e.g., Ctrl+Space brings up the Intellisense for the current tag, but also inserts a space character into the file).  At Â£25 (it's currently on special offer at $50), though, it's quite the bargain.

Next up is to convert the projects' unit tests to NUnit and work those into my build files...  Oh, and I should have an update on my <a href="/coding/2008/06/25/message-passing-a-plug-framework.html" title="Message Passing in a Plug-in Framework">message passing problem</a> relatively soon, too :-)  That, and a question about file encodings that's been troubling me for about a month now.
