            <p>At the end of August, I sent the following message to the members of the Cambridge Software Craftmanship Community.</p>

<hr />
<p>Hi everyone</p>

<p>It’s not often that we email our members, so please bear with me and read this
to the end.</p>

<p>Recent events in the wider tech community, and reactions within the Software
Craftsmanship community, have prompted wider discussions about the inclusiveness
of the community, and I’ve decided to make some small but important changes to
our local chapter.</p>

<p>My experience of the wider Software Craftsmanship community has been one of an
inclusive, diverse, friendly and welcoming environment, to which I hope anyone
who has attended SoCraTes events in the UK and abroad will attest. I believe we, as
a community, have moved beyond the technical focus of the original Craftsmanship
events like SCNA and SCUK to provide discussions and interactions that remain
relevant today, and grow in value with each new voice added. I firmly believe we
are a superset of the original movement, with more to offer to our members and the
industry in general.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> From 1 September, we will be known as Cambridge Software Crafters,
and new attendees will be required to agree to the Community Code of Conduct
defined at https://communitycodeofconduct.com/. We are distancing ourselves from
the recent remarks of Robert Martin.</p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>The infamous Google Memo<a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/evzjww/here-are-the-citations-for-the-anti-diversity-manifesto-circulating-at-google">1</a> written by James Damore kicked off a chain of events
within the wider Software Craftsmanship community that I believe requires action
at the local level to address. Specifically, Robert “Uncle Bob” Martin wrote a
reaction piece to Damore’s firing, entitled <em>Thought Police</em><a href="http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/08/09/ThoughtPolice.html">2</a>. This was a
misguided piece which many took as defending Damore and his views, and the
follow-up posts, <em>On the Diminished Capacity to Discuss Things Rationally</em><a href="http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/08/10/OnTheInabilityToDiscussThingsRationally.html">3</a>
and <em>Women in Tech</em><a href="http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/08/14/WomenInTech.html">4</a> did little to resolve the situation. The latter post in
particular is a poor attempt at an apology that never actually says “sorry”. He
has a history of misogynist statements and essays, so this is not a one-off.</p>

<p>Sarah Mei, a prominent US-based Software Developer whom I respect highly and
whose opinion I value enormously, posted a series of tweets reacting to Martin’s
blog post<a href="https://twitter.com/sarahmei/status/895673739899043841">5</a>, including a critique of Software Craftsmanship and the community.
Her critique is interesting and worth taking the time to read. Two things stood
out for me as a community leader, though: 1) that Sarah considers the word
“Craftsmanship” gendered and exclusionary; and 2) that the association with
Robert Martin reinforced the view that the community is exclusionary.</p>

<p>I will address the second of these directly right now: <strong>Robert Martin does not
speak for me, nor for the community I founded.</strong> Neither is it representative of
the wider community which I have come to love for its inclusiveness and relentless
attempts to improve the diversity of its membership. The views laid out in his
original piece, and his poor apology, are neither opinions nor actions welcome in
our community.</p>

<h2 id="community-name">Community Name</h2>
<p>Sarah’s thread of tweets set me and a bunch of other community leaders thinking
and talking. There is a Slack team which you can join at
http://slack.softwarecraftsmanship.org/; the discussions have been taking place
in the #culture channel. After discussion with the co-organisers of the
Cambridge community, we have agreed to rename the group to “Cambridge Software
Crafters”, and to refer to the “craft” of software rather than to “Craftsmanship”.
We will also be referring to our members as Practitioners or Software Crafters
rather than Software Craftsmen. This change will take effect from 1 September.</p>

<p>You are, of course, free to continue referring to yourself as a Software
Craftsman if you would prefer! Please adopt the new gender-neutral language when
referring to others, however, to help our community be as friendly, inclusive,
and welcoming as we can. A gentle reminder to your fellow community members to
use gender-neutral language in our meetups will go a long way, too.</p>

<h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>When I first started this community in ~2012, codes of conduct were barely
discussed, if they had even been “invented” then. After a number of events,
particularly in the US, experienced some high-profile cases of sexual
harassment, sexualised imagery in slidedecks, and other inappropriate behaviour,
it is now commonplace for events to implement a Code of Conduct.</p>

<p>I have, from the beginning, tried to build a community that is open and friendly
and safe for members to attend. Early efforts focussed on filtering membership
to ensure ethical recruiters who were interested in being an active part of the
community were welcomed. It has, however, taken me a long time – far too long,
in reality – to implement a Code of Conduct for our community, to protect our
members at large. To anyone that has felt uncomfortable within our community,
I am deeply sorry.</p>

<p>As of 1 September, the <a href="https://communitycodeofconduct.com/">Community Code of Conduct</a>
will be in place. All new members will be required to agree explicitly to adhere
to this before joining the community, and continued membership of the community
will be considered a tacit agreement to abide by the code of conduct.</p>

<h2 id="whom-to-contact">Whom to contact</h2>

<p>At least one of the organisers is present at every event we run, and often are
facilitating; they are myself, Amélie Cornélis, Alex Tercete, and Ally Parker.
If you are made to feel uncomfortable because of the words or actions of
another member, and are not able to speak up at the time, please speak to one
of us at the first opportunity so we may address the issue swiftly. We are
easily reachable via Meetup if you prefer online contact.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope I have articulated clearly
the reasons for making these changes. I’ll be briefly reprising this email at
the next Round Table Discussion on 5 September, and am happy to discuss the
changes in person or via email. You can just hit reply on this email to send me
your thoughts.</p>

<p>All the best</p>

<p>Alastair</p>
